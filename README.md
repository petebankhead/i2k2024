# QuPath I2K 2024 repo 

This repo exists to support the in-person & virtual QuPath workshops at I2K 2024 (https://www.i2kconference.org):

* [QuPath for Beginners](scripts/beginners) 🐣
* [QuPath for Fiji Fans](scripts/fiji-fans) 🌅
* [QuPath for Groovy Scripters](scripts/groovy-scripters) 🕺
* [QuPath for Python Programmers](scripts/python-programmers) 🐍

The stuff here will get better before the event (probably, hopefully).
